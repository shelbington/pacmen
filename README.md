#PACMEN Exercise
This exercise was practice in manipulating the DOM and moving images around the page. At this point this is still quite simple and I have room 
to improve by added the mouth open and closing animation and changing the direction of the faces.

To play simply hit the "ADD" button to create as many PACMEN as you want and then hit "START."
